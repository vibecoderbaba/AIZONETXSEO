# Dailybot Progress Report

You help developers keep their team informed. After completing tasks or making broad edits, you send a short progress update to Dailybot. The update reads like a human giving their daily standup — no one should be able to tell it came from an agent.

---

## Agent Compatibility

This skill works across all major AI coding agents. Execution paths differ slightly but the logic is identical.

| Agent | Skill path | Activation |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/skills/dailybot/report/` | `/dailybot_report` slash command |
| OpenClaw | `<workspace>/skills/dailybot_report/` or `~/.openclaw/skills/` | `/dailybot_report` slash command |
| Cursor | `~/.cursor/skills/dailybot/report/` | Natural language trigger |
| OpenAI Codex | `~/.codex/skills/dailybot/report/` | Natural language trigger |
| Windsurf | `~/.codeium/windsurf/skills/dailybot/report/` | Natural language trigger |
| GitHub Copilot | `~/.copilot/skills/dailybot/report/` | Natural language trigger |
| Cline | `~/.cline/skills/dailybot/report/` | Natural language trigger |
| Gemini CLI | `~/.gemini/skills/dailybot/report/` | Natural language trigger |

When natural language triggers apply, the skill activates on phrases like: "report this to Dailybot", "send a Dailybot update", "let my team know what we built".

---

## Step 0 — Optional Auto-Activation Setup (First Run Only)

Auto-activation makes Dailybot reporting fire automatically in future sessions
without the developer invoking the skill each time. **It is opt-in.** Writing
to a global agent config file (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, etc.) affects every
future session in every repository, including unrelated work — so the
developer must explicitly approve it the first time.

### Check if the trigger is already installed

Identify which agent you are and run the corresponding check:

| Agent | Check |
|-------|-------|
| Claude Code | `grep -q "dailybot-auto-activation" ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null && echo "installed"` |
| OpenClaw | *(skip — OpenClaw loads this skill natively on every eligible session)* |
| Cursor | `test -f ~/.cursor/rules/dailybot.mdc && echo "installed"` |
| Codex | `grep -q "dailybot-auto-activation" ~/.codex/AGENTS.md 2>/dev/null && echo "installed"` |
| Windsurf | `test -f .windsurf/rules/dailybot.md && echo "installed"` |
| Copilot | `grep -q "dailybot-auto-activation" ~/.agents/AGENTS.md 2>/dev/null && echo "installed"` |
| Cline | `grep -q "dailybot-auto-activation" ~/.cline/.clinerules 2>/dev/null && echo "installed"` |
| Gemini CLI | `grep -q "dailybot-auto-activation" ~/.gemini/GEMINI.md 2>/dev/null && echo "installed"` |

If output says "installed" — skip to Step 1.

### If missing — ask before creating

Read [`triggers.md`](triggers.md) for the exact file path and content for the
current agent.

If `DAILYBOT_AUTO_YES=1` is set in the environment, treat consent as already
given — write the trigger block straight away and skip the prompt below.
Otherwise, show the developer this prompt **before writing anything**:

> "Dailybot reporting can run automatically after every task or broad edit,
> across all your future sessions. To set that up, I'd add the block below to
> **`<file path>`**:
>
> ```
> <exact content from triggers.md, including the
> dailybot-auto-activation markers>
> ```
>
> This affects **every repository** you open with this agent. To uninstall
> later, delete the marked block — see the `Uninstall` section in the README.
>
> **Should I add it now?** (yes / no / not now)"

- **Yes** — write the trigger block exactly as shown, including the
  `dailybot-auto-activation` opening and closing markers from `triggers.md`,
  then continue to Step 1.
- **No / not now** — skip auto-activation for this session and continue to
  Step 1. Do not re-ask in the same session.

If the developer accepts, briefly confirm:

> "Added. From your next session onward, Dailybot reporting fires
> automatically. Remove the marked block in `<file path>` to disable."

Then proceed to Step 1.

## Step 1 — Verify Setup

Read and follow the authentication steps in [`../shared/auth.md`](../shared/auth.md). That file covers CLI installation, login, API key setup, and agent profile configuration.

If auth fails or the developer declines, skip reporting entirely and continue with your primary task.

---

## Step 2 — Choose Execution Path

```bash
command -v dailybot
```

- **CLI found** → Step 4A
- **CLI not found** → Step 4B (see [`../shared/http-fallback.md`](../shared/http-fallback.md) for the base curl patterns)

Both paths produce identical results. Prefer CLI — it handles auth and retries automatically. Fall back to HTTP in sandboxed environments, CI, or containers where the CLI cannot be installed.

---

## Step 3 — Detect Context

### 3a. Run the bundled script

Find `context.sh` in the `shared/` directory of the Dailybot skill pack and run it:

```bash
bash ~/.cursor/skills/dailybot/shared/context.sh
```

Adjust the base path to match your agent's skill directory (e.g., `~/.claude/skills/dailybot/`, `~/.codex/skills/dailybot/`).

Outputs JSON: `{"repo":"...","branch":"...","agent_tool":"...","agent_name":"..."}`. Capture it.

### 3b. Manual fallback (any agent)

See the header comments in [`../shared/context.sh`](../shared/context.sh) for the manual fallback commands:

```bash
# repo name
git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null | sed 's|.*/||;s|\.git$||'

# branch
git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null
```

If git commands fail, use the current folder name for repo and `"unknown"` for branch.

Assemble metadata — include your model identifier:

```json
{
  "repo": "<repo_name>",
  "branch": "<branch_name>",
  "agent_tool": "<your_tool>",
  "agent_name": "<your_name_or_profile_name>",
  "model": "<your_model>"
}
```

Model identifier examples: `"claude-sonnet-4-6"`, `"o3"`, `"gemini-2.5-pro"`, `"gpt-4o"`.

## Step 4A — Send Report via CLI

> Use this path when `command -v dailybot` succeeds.
>
> **Timeout**: Allow at least 30 seconds for CLI commands to complete. Do not use a shorter timeout.

### Flag reference

| Flag | Short | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `--name` | `-n` | Agent worker name (omit if default profile configured) |
| `--json-data` | `-j` | Structured JSON data |
| `--metadata` | `-d` | JSON metadata (repo, branch, model, etc.) |
| `--milestone` | `-m` | Mark as a milestone accomplishment |
| `--co-authors` | `-c` | Co-author email or UUID (repeatable, or comma-separated) |

### Plain report

```bash
dailybot agent update "<message>" \
  --name "<agent_name>" \
  --metadata '<metadata_json>'
```

### Rich report (multiple deliverables)

```bash
dailybot agent update "<message>" \
  --name "<agent_name>" \
  --json-data '<structured_json>' \
  --metadata '<metadata_json>'
```

### Milestone report

```bash
dailybot agent update "<message>" \
  --name "<agent_name>" \
  --milestone \
  --json-data '<structured_json>' \
  --metadata '<metadata_json>'
```

### Using a named profile

If a non-default profile was configured during auth setup:

```bash
dailybot agent --profile <profile_name> update "<message>" ...
```

---

## Step 4B — Send Report via HTTP API

> Use this path when the CLI is unavailable. Requires `curl`. See [`../shared/http-fallback.md`](../shared/http-fallback.md) for the base patterns.

**Base URL:** `https://api.dailybot.com`
**Auth header:** `X-API-KEY: $DAILYBOT_API_KEY`

### Plain report

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://api.dailybot.com/v1/agent-reports/ \
  -H "X-API-KEY: $DAILYBOT_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agent_name": "<agent_name>",
    "content": "<message>",
    "metadata": <metadata_json>
  }'
```

### Rich report

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://api.dailybot.com/v1/agent-reports/ \
  -H "X-API-KEY: $DAILYBOT_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agent_name": "<agent_name>",
    "content": "<message>",
    "structured": {
      "completed": ["Deliverable 1", "Deliverable 2"],
      "in_progress": ["Item still being worked on"],
      "blockers": []
    },
    "metadata": <metadata_json>
  }'
```

### Milestone report

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://api.dailybot.com/v1/agent-reports/ \
  -H "X-API-KEY: $DAILYBOT_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agent_name": "<agent_name>",
    "content": "<message>",
    "is_milestone": true,
    "structured": {
      "completed": ["..."],
      "in_progress": [],
      "blockers": []
    },
    "metadata": <metadata_json>
  }'
```

---

## Step 5 — Trigger Check

Send a progress report after each of the following:

1. **Task completed** — You finished a discrete task or subtask (e.g., a todo item, a user-requested change, a bug fix, a feature).
2. **Broad edit** — You modified 3 or more files in a single batch of edits.

Once auth is set up and (if applicable) the auto-activation trigger is in
place, you do not need to re-confirm each individual report — the developer
already opted in. Don't second-guess whether the work is "significant
enough"; if either condition above is met, send the report.

If the developer explicitly asks you to report, always report regardless of these conditions.

### What to include

Every report must answer two questions:
- **What changed** — concrete outcomes, not file paths
- **Why** — the purpose or motivation behind the change

### Aggregate related work

If you completed multiple related changes, combine them into one report. Don't send 3 reports for parts of one feature — send one report covering the whole thing.

For detailed guidelines, see [`significance.md`](significance.md).

---

## Step 6 — Compose the Report

### The Human-First Principle

The developer directed the effort, made the decisions, and is accountable for the result. Your report reflects **their accomplishment**.

**Golden rule:** The reader should never be able to tell whether a human or an agent wrote the report.

- Never say "Agent completed...", "Claude did...", "I implemented...", "The AI built..."
- Focus on outcomes: what was accomplished and why it matters
- Always write in **English**, regardless of conversation language
- 1–3 sentences maximum, past tense

### Report type

**Plain report** — single bug fix, small feature, one-off task. Message + metadata only.

**Rich report** — multi-deliverable feature, major refactor, complex task. Message + structured data + optional milestone flag.

### Structured data format

```json
{
  "completed": ["Deliverable 1", "Deliverable 2"],
  "in_progress": ["Item still being worked on"],
  "blockers": ["Issue preventing progress"]
}
```

Each item: concise, human-readable string. Empty arrays are fine.

### Milestone flag

Mark a report as a milestone only when the **top-level task is fully completed** — all subtasks are done and the entire requested piece of work is wrapped up. Individual subtask completions are regular reports, not milestones. If the developer explicitly asks for a milestone, always honor it.

### Co-authors

Do not add `--co-authors` by default — Dailybot automatically credits the authenticated developer. Only add if the developer explicitly asks to credit someone else. Never guess email addresses.

### Forbidden in report messages

| Forbidden | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| File paths (`app/auth.py`) | Nobody reads paths in a standup |
| Git statistics (`+127 -12`) | Meaningless without context |
| Raw commit messages (`feat(scope): ...`) | Commit syntax is for git, not humans |
| Branch names (`pushed to dev`) | Internal workflow detail |
| Agent attribution (`Agent completed...`) | Violates the Human-First Principle |
| Plan or task IDs (`PLAN_auth`, `task-3`) | Internal identifiers |
| Non-English text | All reports must be in English |
| Vague fallbacks (`Updated code`, `Made changes`) | If you can't be specific, don't report |

For writing templates by work type, see [`writing-guide.md`](writing-guide.md).
For side-by-side examples, see [`examples.md`](examples.md).

---

## Step 7 — Confirm

After the command runs:

- **Success** — briefly confirm what was reported. Example: *"Reported to Dailybot: Built the notification preferences system with full test coverage."*
- **Failure** — warn briefly. Do not retry in a loop. Suggest `dailybot status --auth` for auth issues, or `dailybot logout` + `dailybot login` if the session seems stale.
- **Skipped** — say nothing. Complete silence is the correct response.

---

## Non-Blocking Rule

Reporting must **never block your primary work**. If the CLI is missing, auth fails, the network is down, or the command errors:

1. Warn the developer briefly
2. Continue with the primary task
3. Do not retry automatically
4. Do not enter a diagnostic loop
